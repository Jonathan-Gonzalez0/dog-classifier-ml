# 🐶 Dog Image Classifier (Logistic Regression)

This project is a **machine learning model** built from scratch in Python to classify dog images using **logistic regression**.  
It was trained on a dataset of **8,000 labeled dog photos** with preprocessing and feature extraction steps.  
The goal was to implement a baseline image classifier using classical ML techniques before moving toward more advanced models (e.g., NNNs).
